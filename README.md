# II_SRUK_Scientific_Computing
This repository contains the material for the II edition of the SRUK Scientific Computing. The next subsections contain important information about how to install the software required for the workshop as well as the practical sessions that will be carried out. Note that the latter will not be available until the day of the workshop.

## R and Python: get yourself started!
We are going to learn how to program in R and Python, so you need to first download this software before attending the workshop.   

   * [Installing R](https://github.com/dalonsoa/scientific_computing/blob/master/installing_R.md)   
   * [Installing Python](https://github.com/dalonsoa/scientific_computing/blob/master/installing_python.md)

## The shell terminal
If you are a Mac OS or a Linux user, you will already have access to the terminal. However, if you are a Windows user, we recommend you to follow the instructions given in the first link below so you can easily follow the `Introduction to the UNIX shell` session of the workshop. For Mac OS and Linux users, we have added an explanation of how you can open the terminal in case you have never done this before. You can follow the corresponding links below:   

   * [How to start working with the terminal in Windows](https://github.com/dalonsoa/scientific_computing/blob/master/Terminal_in_Windows.md)   
   * The terminal in Mac OS   
   * The terminal in Linux

## Good programming practice

And last, but not least, a piece of advice for your programming practice! As newcomers to the programming world, it is easier for you to start applying from your very first code a good programming practice as you do not have to remove bad programming habits. Therefore, we encourage you to read some tips we have learnt through our experience which have improved the quality of our coding and saved many hours of debugging. We hope you take your time to go through them and follow them from the very beginning. You will see that they are easy to understand, easy to remember, and easy to apply to your coding style :smile:

## Practical sessions

The following links will open the material for the sessions that will be run in the workshop. However, note that these will not be available until the day of the workshop :smile:

   * Introduction to the UNIX shell   
   * Introduction to Python
