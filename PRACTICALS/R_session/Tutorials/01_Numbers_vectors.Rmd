```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

In the revision part, we have seen that there are three different types of classes for vectors that store numbers: numeric, integer, and complex. Run the following code to see some examples of these classes of vectors:

```{r}
a_int <- -786L
class( a_int )

b_complex <- 3+2i 
class( b_complex )

c_num <- 1.5
class( c_num )
```

Note that sometimes you do not see a decimal part in a numeric vector even though its class is numeric. If you really want to be working with integers, make sure to use the corresponding coercion function!

Do you remember that we have seen some "functions for coercion"? Imagine that we want to change a numeric vector into an integer one:

```{r}
num_to_int <- as.integer( c_num )
class( num_to_int )
num_to_int
```

Do you see what has happend? The decimal part of `1.5`, value assigned to the variable `c_num` has been removed to keep only the integer part as asked. That is why you see that this new variable `num_to_int` equals to `1` :smile: 

Just remember: If you want to check the class of a vector, you can always run the function `is.<CLASS_NAME>( <VARIABLE> )`. For instance:

```{r}
x <- 7
is.integer( x )
is.numeric( x )
is.complex( x )
is.character( x )
is.null( x )
is.matrix( x )
is.data.frame( x )
```

### QUICK EXERCISES

### Exercise 1  
Try to remember which was the function used to change the class of a variable to complex. Then, change the class of the `c_num` variable to complex.
  
### Exercise 2  
Now try to remember the function to change the class of a variable into numeric. Then, change the class of the `a_int` variable to numeric.

## 1. R as a calculator

One of the most useful utilities of R is that it can be used as a calculator! Therefore, you can use all the variables to store numbers as their corresponding value which will be part of future calculations in your code. Run the examples below and get familiar with the syntax used: 

```{r}
a <- 2 
b <- 5 

# Sum 
a + b 

# Subtraction
a - b 

# Multiplication
a * b

# Divison
a / b

# Square root
sqrt ( a )

# Exponentiation
a^b

# Get the remainder of a division
a %% b

# Get the quotient of a division
a %/% b
```

---

### QUICK EXERCISES 

### Exercise 1  
Store in a new variable the result of `a` to the power of `2` and write a condition that prints the result of this calculation if this is higher than `5`.

### Exercise 2  
Store in a new variable the result of the square root `b` and write a condition that prints the remainder of dividing `b` into this new variable if this new variable is smaller than the result you got in exercise 1.

## 2. Some useful functions

The last part of this tutorial will guide you through some R functions that you can use for some calculations. 

### 2.1. Function `sum()`
You can type `?sum` on the console to see how it works. In the next example, we are going to create a numeric vector with more than one value. We are going to use this function to get the sum of all the values of this vector. When we create this kind of vector, we always put a `c` (which means "combine") followed by parentheses. Inside the parentheses, we type all the values separated by commas. Pay attention to what happens when you place a colon, `:`, between two numbers!

```{r}
vector_1 <- c( 1, 4, 5, 7:9, 12 )
vector_1
sum( vector_1 )
```

Have you noticed that `7:9` has returned the sequence from 7 to 9? You can have a sequence between two values by separating them using the colon, `:`, or you can also use the function `seq()`. Type `?seq` to see how this function works.

---

### QUICK EXERCISES 

### Exercise 1  
Create two different numeric vectors with as many values as you want. Then, use the function `sum` to get the result of summing the values in both vectors.

### Exercise 2
Create a vector that contains a sequence from 1 to 10.

### Exercise 3   
Create a vector that contains a sequence from 5 to 1. Note that the output should be `5 4 3 2 1`.
   
### Exercise 4  
Create a vector that contains a sequence from 1 to 10 every two numbers, i.e., it should return `1 3 5 7 9`.
  ***HINT***: Look how `seq()` can be used for that!

---

### 2.2. Functions `min()` and `max()`
Type `?min` and `?max` on the console to see how these functions work. Now run the code below and try to understand the values you are returned:

```{r}
max( vector_1 )
min( vector_1 )
```

---

### QUICK EXERCISE 
Write a code that prints `Maximum and minimum are equal` if the maximum number of a vector you create does not equal to the minimum number of this same vector. Otherwise, it should print `Maximum and minimum are equal`, if they are equal.

---

### 2.3. Function `rep()`
Type `?rep` and take a look at how this function works. Imagine that you want a vector with a specific value repeated X times. You can use this function as shown in the following example:

```{r} 
vector_2 <- rep( 6, times = 5)
vector_2
```

---

### QUICK EXERCISE 
Repeat a sequence from 1 to 3 five times.

---

There are many other functions that we can use, but we will either see them in the next tutorials or you will find them when working with your own data!
Now it is time for some more exercises!

## 3. Exercises 

Before getting started with the exercises for this tutorial, please make sure that you have checked the following built-in functions and you understand how to use them. Otherwise, ask us for help!
Functions: `floor`, `trunc`, `round`, `union`, `intersect`, `setdiff`, `length`.

### Exercise 1
Create two different numeric vectors and find which values are different between the two vectors.

### Exercise 2  
Now find which values are the same.

### Exercise 3  
Create a third vector that contains the union of these two vectors.

### Exercise 4 
Assign the value `6.5789485` to a variable. Find out the class of this vector. Afterwards, round this value to the third digit.

### Exercise 5  
Now truncate this same value.

### Exercise 6  
Create a vector named `test1` that contains a sequence of values from 1 to 3 increasing every 0.3 units.  
What is happening when you use the function `floor( test1 )`?

### Exercise 7  
Create a vector named `test2` that contains a sequence of values from 1 to 20 increasing every 0.7 units. 
How many values does `test2` contain?

### Exercise 8  
Write some code that prints `Vector test1 has more values than test2:`, followed by the length of `test1`. *Remember the function `cat()` that we have seen in the previous tutorial, which can print both vectors of class character and numeric/integer/complex*. Otherwise, if `test2` has more elements, the code should print `Vector test2 has more values than test1:`, followed by the length of `test2`. Last, if both lengths are equal, the message that should be printed is `Both lengths are the same:` followed by the corresponding length.
