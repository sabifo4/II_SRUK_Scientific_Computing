```{r setup, include=FALSE}

```

In this tutorial, we are going to play with some data frames. Furthermore, we are going to learn how we would import them from a data file!

## 1. Starting with a classical example

First of all, we are going to work with the typical in-built data frame object in R: `mtcars`. Type this name in the terminal to explore its content:

```{r}
mtcars
```
---

### QUICK EXERCISE
Get the dimensions, the rownames, and the colnames of this data frame. Afterwards, access the second column.

## 2. Acessing the elements of a data frame
You have two ways of getting the number of rows and columns separated.

```{r}
# Rows
dim( mtcars )[ 1 ]
all.equal( dim( mtcars )[ 1 ], nrow( mtcars ) )

# Columns
dim( mtcars )[ 2 ]
all.equal( dim( mtcars )[ 2 ], ncol( mtcars ) )
```

If you want to access an element of the `data.frame`, it works exactly as in the matrices. For instance, if you want to access the element from the first to the second row and from the first to the third column:
```{r}
mtcars[ 1:2, 1:3 ]
```

## 3. Saving a data frame in a file 

If you want to save this data, remember to have previously set your working directory!
After that, we are going to use the function `write.table()` to save this data frame. In order to create a character vector with our path, which is needed for the argument `file`, we are going to use the function `paste()`. Uncomment the following code and let's go through the next code to discuss together what the code below does:

```{r}
# wd <- "path_to_your_wd"
# setwd( wd )
# write.table( x = mtcars, file = paste( wd, "mtcars_df.csv", sep = "" ),
#              quote = F, sep = ",")
# write.table( x = mtcars, file = paste( wd, "mtcars_df.tsv", sep = "" ),
#              quote = F, sep = "\t")

```

## 3. Opening a file and saving it as a data frame

Now, if you want to open this file, you can use the function `read.table()` and save it into a variable so you can later explore this data frame. Uncomment the following code to see how this is done:

```{r}

# mtcars_fromread <- read.table( file = paste( wd, "mtcars_df.csv", sep = "" ),
#                                header = T, stringsAsFactors = F,
#                                sep = ",", na.strings = "NA"
#                                )

```

Now, you can see that both data sets are the same!

```{r}
# Uncomment the following code
# all.equal( mtcars, mtcars_fromread)
```

***NOTE***: If you had two data frames and you wanted to combine the columns present in both data frames, you could use the function `merge()`.
