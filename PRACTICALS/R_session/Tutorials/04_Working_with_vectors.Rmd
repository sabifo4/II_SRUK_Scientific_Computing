# 1. How to access and manipulate the elements of the vectors? 

You now know how to work with the different types of R vectors. However, imagine that you want to know what the value at a specific position is or that you might even want to change it. How do you access this element? Let's see some examples!

Do you remember the character vector with fruits?

```{r}
fruits <- c( "strawberry", "apple", "orange", "mango" )
```

Imagine that you want to access the second element, `apple`. The syntax to be used consists of writing the name of the variable and, next to it and within square brackets, you type the number corresponding to the position where the element you want to access is in the vector `fruits`. In this case:

```{r}
fruits[ 2 ]
```

The same applies to other types of vector. For instance, imagine the following numeric vector:

```{r}
bets <- c( 5, 100, 60, 80, 2, 64, 234, 1004 )
bets[ 3 ]
```

The cool thing about being able to access specific elements of the vectors, is that you can **CHANGE THEM**.
Let's see some examples:

### EXAMPLE 1 

```{r}
fruits[ 2 ] <- "mandarin"
fruits
```

In this first example, we have changed the element in the second position, `apple`, into `mandarin`. Therefore, when you print the vector `fruits`, the element `apple` is no longer there. However, you can add it back, if you want to:

```{r}
fruits <- c( fruits, "apple" )
fruits
```

And then remove it again:

```{r}
fruits <- fruits[ -length(fruits) ]
fruits
```

And then put it back :smile:

```{r}
fruits <- c( fruits, "apple" )
fruits
```

### EXAMPLE 2 

```{r}
bets[ 2:4 ] <- rep( 6, times = length( 2:4 ) )
bets

``` 

In this second example, we have changed the values that are in positions from 2 to 4 to be `6`. Note what we have done in times. This is useful in case you do not want to count how many values you want this to be. As you know that you are going to be replacing something in the range from 2 to 4, you know that you must replace the same amount of `6` that the amount of values in the range. Therefore, you can get the length of this range of values, and then just place it as the number of times the value `6` has to be repeated. This is then going to replace the elements in vector `bet` that are in the positions ranging from 2 to 4 (i.e., this will happen 3 times).

---

### THINKING EXERCISE
Create the following vector: `sample_vec <- c( 1, 80, 1, 41, 235, 7, 4 )`.
Now, grep the value `1` from that vector. You will be returned the positions of the values that contain `1` in `sample_vec`. Save this output in a new vector and use it to replace the corresponding values with `YES`.

---

You can also name the elements of your vectors. In order to do this, you can use the function `name()`. Type `?name` if you want to know more about this function. Once you have named the elements of your vector, you can also use them to access the corresponding value in that position. Here you have an example:

```{r}
animals <- c( "cat", "dog", "monkey" )
names( animals ) <- c( "an.1", "an.2", "an.3" )
animals
animals[ 3 ]
animals[ "an.3" ]

all.equal( animals[ 3 ], animals[ "an.3" ] )
```

This last function is very useful when you want to check if the content of two vectors is equal. If it is equal, it will return `TRUE`. Otherwise, it returns `FALSE`.

--- 
### QUICK EXERCISES

* ### Exercise 1  
  Create a numeric vector with 3 values and put a name for each of them. After that, access the value in the second position using the name that you have given to the vector.
* ### Exercise 2  
  Remove the second value of this vector.

# 2. Practising loops

Until now, you have been practising with some conditionals. However, now it is time for you to take a look at how a loop might look like!

### EXAMPLE 3

```{r}
for ( fruit in seq( 1:length( fruits ) ) ){
  
  cat( "I like to eat", fruits[ fruit ], "\n" )  
  
}
```

In this first example, we are iterating over all the elements that are inside the vector `fruits`. We are using the variable `fruit` as the number that will indicate the position from which we want to access the vector `fruits` (it is like the variable `iter` we saw in the revision part).
In order to specify how long the `for` loop has to run, we use `seq( 1:length( fruits ) )`. If you run this individually,

```{r}
seq( 1:length( fruits ) )
```

you will see that you get numbers ranging from 1 to 6. This means that every single time the `for` loop runs, the variable `fruit` will take values from 1 to 6. After that, every single time that the variable `fruit` appears in the code inside the `for` loop, the corresponding value will be used there. This means that what you are really doing is using the value that the variable `fruit` has for a given iteration to access the corresponding element of the vector `fruits`. Therefore, you go from position 1 to position 6 in vector `fruits`, i.e., `fruits = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6`.

A more difficult example of a `for` loop is a **NESTED** `for` loop. This is a `for` loop inside a `for` loop.
Run the following example and try to figure out what it is doing by looking at what is being printed. After that, let's discuss this here!

### EXAMPLE 4 

```{r}
places <- c( "Bethnal Green", "Hackney Road", "Romand Road")
for ( fruit in seq( 1:length( fruits ) ) ){
  
  for ( place in seq( 1:length( places ) ) ){
    
    cat( "I like to eat", fruits[ fruit ], "in", places[ place ], "\n" ) 
    
  }
  
  cat( "\n" )
  
}
```

As an exercise, partner with your class mates, form groups, and practise a variation of the nested `for` loop in example 4 (e.g., printing different things, changing the variables, etc.) with the help of the tutors.  

# 3. Functions

Last, we will see how to create a very simple function using a conditional and a `for` loop. However, we are going to first create one function that takes one argument and then returns its double. The syntax is the following:

```{r}
double_function <- function ( x ){
  
  return( 2*x )
  
}
```

Now, when we want to call it, we dp it as if it was an in-built function in R. We first name a variable and assign it a value, and then we pass this variable to the argument `x` of the function:

```{r}
var_func <- 10 
double_function( var_func )
```

Now you see how your function has returned `20`!
Let's add a bit of complexity inside our function :smile:

```{r}
function_2 <- function ( x ){
  
  if ( x <  0 ){
    return( abs( x ) )
  }else{
    cat( "Your value is not negative!\n")
    return( x^2 )
  }
  
}
result_func2 <- function_2( var_func )

```

What is this function doing now? Now, it is taking the argument that you pass it and it is checking if it is negative first.
If it is negative, it will return the absolute value. However, if it is not, then it will first print a message letting you know that your value is not negative and then it will return this value to the power of 2, which we store as a value of a variable named `result_func2`

## EXERCISE
Use the nested `for` loop of the previous example and put it inside a function. This function will use two arguments: `fruits` and `places`. After that, run your function with the corresponding vectors. When you observe the results, discuss with your class mates this result and think of which alternative vectors you can pass to your function and if you would like to change the name of the arguments of your function.


# 4. How to plot vectors? 

A very important part of dealing with your data is knowing how to visualize it. The function `plot()` is a basic function to plot two vectors in the X and Y axis.
You can type `?plot` to see all the rest of arguments that you can pass to that function, which can make your plot look much nicer!
The quickest thing to do is to plot two numeric vectors one against the other:

```{r}
x <- seq( 1:10 )
y <- (seq( 1:10 ) + 4 ) / 0.25

plot( x, y )
```

You can also do some barplots. Check `?barplot` before going through the next examples. 


### EXAMPLE 1 
```R 
barplot( x )
```

### EXAMPLE 2
```R 
expenses <- c( 50, 150, 30, 300 )
names( expenses ) <- c( "Jan", "Feb", "Mar", "Apr" )
```
### Plot 1
```R 
barplot( expenses )
```
### Plot 2
```R 
barplot( expenses, col = c( "green", "orange", "green", "red" ) )
```
### Plot 3
```R 
barplot( expenses, col = c( "green", "orange", "green", "red" ),
         main = "Expenses 2018")
```
### Plot 4
```R 
barplot( expenses, col = c( "green", "orange", "green", "red" ),
         main = "Expenses 2018",
         xlab = "Months", ylab = "Money spent")
```
### Plot 5
```R 
barplot( expenses, col = c( "green", "orange", "green", "red" ),
         main = "Expenses 2018",
         xlab = "Months", ylab = "Money spent")
pos.xy <- locator()
```
### Plot 6
```R 
barplot( expenses, col = c( "green", "orange", "green", "red" ),
         main = "Expenses 2018",
         xlab = "Months", ylab = "Money spent")
legend( x = pos.xy$x,
        y = pos.xy$y,
        legend = c( "Good!", "Be careful!", "You burnt the VISA..."),
        col = c( "green", "orange", "red" ), pch = 15 )
```
### Plot 7
```R 
barplot( expenses, col = c( "green", "orange", "green", "red" ),
         main = "Expenses 2018",
         xlab = "Months", ylab = "Money spent")
lines(expenses, lty = 2)
points(expenses)
legend( x = pos.xy$x,
        y = pos.xy$y,
        legend = c( "Good!", "Be careful!", "You burnt the VISA..."),
        col = c( "green", "orange", "red" ), pch = 15 )
```
**NOTES**: Look into the built-in functions `?legend`, `?pch`, `?lines`, `?density`, `?lty`.

### EXERCISE
Design your own barplot and play with the different arguments that can be passed to the barplot function
After that, look at examples of other types of plots with the built-in functions `boxplot`, `histogram`, `contour`. Ask any questions you might have about them!

# 5. How to deal with NA values?

Sometimes, you might have data with missing values. The word that R has reserved to call the missing value/s is `NA`. You will see that it is blue when you type it, which means that you cannot use it for anything else as it has this specific meaning.

If your data have `NA` values, there are going to be some functions that cannot work and will return `NA` if your vector contains missing values. You should always check the documentation before running a function to see if there is an argument to specify that your data have `NA` values. For instance, look at the `sum()` function:

```{r}
results <- c( 1, 2, 1, 1, NA, NA, 2, 2 )
sum( results )
sum( results, na.rm = TRUE )
```

You can also combine the functions `which()` and `is.na()` to find the `NA` values. Type `?which` and `?is.na` to see how they work and then run the following code:

```{r}
na_values <- which( is.na( results ) )
results <- results[ -na_values ]
results
```

What has this code done? Think a bit and then continue reading for the solution.

Specifically, this code is finding the positions in the vector `results` has missing values. After that, they are saved in the vector named `na_values`. This vector `na_values` is then used to remove the `NA` values from the vector results.

Note that the function `which()` is very powerful. You can also use it to find specific values in your data. For instance, imagine that you want to find the value/s `2` in the vector `results`:

```{r}
which( results == 2 )
```

This code will return you the positions in `results` where the values `2` are.

### QUICK EXERCISES 

* ### Exercise 1  
  You have the following vector: `results_103 <- c( NA, 1, 3, 5, 6, 7, 10, -3, NA, NA, -4 )`
  Find the `NA` values and remove them.
  
* ### Exercise 2  
  Which is the sum of the values in `results_103`?
* ### Exercise 3 (HARD!)  
  Find the maximum value and the minimum value in this vector
  ***HINT***: Remember the `max()` and `min()` functions! Plus, you want the maximum and minimum values, not their positions!
